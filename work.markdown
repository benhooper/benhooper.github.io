# I'm a network engineer at the Met Office...

And my current projects mean I'm thinking about NAC, SD-WAN, and load-balancing services and applications

# But for the last couple of years I've been focussed on...

- DNS
- Secure access, VPNs, TLS
- routing and switching

# I'll blog here occasionally...

About what I'm working on, what I've been studying, and anything that might take my fancy; but I think it'll mainly be for me to collect ideas and practice some non-technical skills
